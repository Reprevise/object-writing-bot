# Object Writing Bot

This bot was primarily made for Emei's Discord server. The primary function of this bot
is to generate a random object everyday at a configurable time, and create a thread for
users to post their object writings in. This bot does not include a timer as it wouldn't
be "fair" to people in different timezones. There could be the option of posting multiple
times per day to consider other timezones w/ a timer, but that is yet to be considered.

## Get Started

Let's get the bot in your server. Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1158214395407642644&permissions=51539618816&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
to invite the bot to your server. Next, run /setup in a channel where you run bot commands.
Follow the steps, and then the bot will be setup.
